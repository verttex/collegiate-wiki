<p>Structure options, president/vp, officers, needed roles, optional roles, responsibilities. Recommendation to write up a charter (usually required by some universities).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>splitting gaming and esports, separate clubs, makes it easier for universities to support esports by itself</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>recommendation to collaborate with other clubs, help them out, and let them use your resources as you grow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>planning tools, discord/slack for communication, google docs for meeting notes, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i think longform roles and responsibilites underneath the roles are good, but i think this should basically be a jumping off point. every school is different and schools have different needs. biggest thing is to rise to the occasion when a need is warranted, or when a student offers to fulfill a role.</p>
