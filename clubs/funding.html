<h1>Recommended Steps</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Find out what funding options are available to your club. Your faculty advisor or student organization office is a great resource for this.</li>
  <li>Read through the fine print — application requirements, usage requirements, timelines and deadlines, etc. Any type of funding is always locked behind a protective layer of policies and restrictions.</li>
  <li>Based on the application timeline, pick an event or club initiative for funding, and start the funding application ASAP. Generally, you’ll need to provide event details on your application, so make sure you have things like room reservations locked in ahead of time.</li>
  <li>Double check your information and submit your funding application before the deadline — most funding applications will have very specific submission ranges that correlate to your event date.</li>
  <li>Once your funding application is approved, follow the purchasing and documentation requirements.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Advice &amp; Suggestions</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Apply for funding early in the semester. This will save you a ton of hassle later.</li>
  <li>Usually, colleges will restrict how you can spend your funding to certain categories. Use your school funding to support these categories so you can allocate your club funds and sponsorship funds for categories that your school doesn’t support, like gaming equipment.</li>
  <li>Many schools will have multiple funding options for categories outside of events, like travel, guest speakers, and research. Find out what options are available and take advantage of them.</li>
  <li>Sometimes, schools will have obscure grants that you can apply for if your event meets certain requirements, such as “supporting the environment”. Look around in different departments!</li>
</ul>
